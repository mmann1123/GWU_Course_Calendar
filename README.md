## Edit Mode (For Department Admins)

The interactive calendar includes a powerful **Edit Mode** for planning and modifying course schedules. This is especially useful for department administrators who need to:

### Features

- **Add New Courses**: Create courses from scratch with all details
- **Edit Existing Courses**: Modify any course attribute (instructor, time, room, etc.)
- **Duplicate Courses**: Quickly create new sections based on existing courses
- **Delete Courses**: Remove courses from the schedule
- **Visual Editing**: See changes reflected immediately in the calendar
- **Export to CSV**: Save your edited schedule in a sortable spreadsheet format

### How to Use Edit Mode

![edit mode demo](static/editmode.gif)

1. **Open the calendar HTML file** in your web browser
2. **Click the "✏️ Edit Schedule" tab** at the top
3. **Make changes**:
   - Click "➕ Add New Course" to create a new course
   - Click any course block to edit its details
   - Use the "Duplicate" button to create new sections
   - Use the "Delete" button to remove courses

### Editing Course Details

When you edit a course, you can modify:

- **Subject Code**: Department code (e.g., GEOG, CSCI)
- **Course Number**: The course identifier (e.g., 1001, 2101)
- **Section**: Section number (e.g., 10, 11, 12)
- **CRN**: Course Registration Number
- **Course Title**: Full name of the course
- **Credits**: Number of credit hours
- **Instructor**: Name (Last, F format recommended)
- **Days**: Use presets (MW, TR, MWF) or select custom days
- **Time**: Start and end times (10-minute intervals)
- **Building & Room**: Location information
- **Dates**: Semester date range

### Smart Day Selection

The editor includes convenient day patterns:

- **MW** - Monday/Wednesday
- **TR** - Tuesday/Thursday
- **MWF** - Monday/Wednesday/Friday
- **MTWRF** - Every weekday
- **Custom** - Select any combination

<!-- ### Conflict Detection

Edit Mode automatically detects and displays:

- **Room Conflicts**: Multiple courses in the same room at the same time
- **Instructor Conflicts**: Instructors teaching multiple courses simultaneously
- **Ignore Option**: You can mark known conflicts as "ignored" (saved to your browser) -->

### Exporting Your Schedule

Click **"📥 Export to CSV"** at the bottom of Edit Mode to:

- Save your edited schedule as a CSV file
- Data is automatically sorted by instructor, then course number
- CSV includes all course details in separate columns
- Open in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet software

### CSV Export Format

The exported CSV includes these columns:

```csv
CRN, Subject, CourseNum, Section, Title, Credits, Instructor, Days, StartTime, EndTime, Building, Room, Dates
```

### Change Tracking

- The interface shows a counter of unsaved changes
- Modified courses are marked with a ⚠️ indicator
- Hover over courses to see details and identify which to edit
- All changes are stored in the browser (not permanent until exported)

### Tips

- **Duplicate for efficiency**: Creating multiple sections? Edit one course, then duplicate it and change only the section/time/room
- **Export regularly**: Your edits are only saved when you export to CSV
- **Use conflict detection**: Review the "⚠️ Conflicts" tab to catch scheduling issues
- **Sort exports**: CSV exports are pre-sorted by instructor and course number for easy review

## Troubleshooting

### "Python is not recognized" or "command not found"
- **Windows**: Restart your computer after installing Python from the Microsoft Store
- **Mac/Linux**: Make sure Python is installed (try `python3 --version` in Terminal)

### The terminal window closes immediately
- **Windows**: Make sure you're double-clicking `launch_gui.bat` (not `launch_gui.sh`)
- **Mac/Linux**: Make sure you're running `./launch_gui.sh` (not `launch_gui.bat`)

### "No module named 'tkinter'" error
- **Mac**: Run `brew install python-tk`
- **Linux**: Run `sudo apt install python3-tk` (Ubuntu/Debian)

### No courses found
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the subject code is correct (must be 4 letters)
- Make sure the semester/year combination is valid (courses might not be posted yet)

### The app installed missing packages automatically
- This is normal! The first time you run it, the app will install BeautifulSoup and Requests
- This only happens once

---

## Tips

- **Save calendars for multiple subjects**: Run the app multiple times with different subject codes
- **Change the output filename**: In the app, edit the "Output Filename" field before scraping
- **Share calendars**: The HTML file can be emailed or shared - it works on any device with a web browser
- **Print your schedule**: Open the HTML file and print from your browser
